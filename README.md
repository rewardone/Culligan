# Water Softener
The Excel sheet contains a listing of endpoints and what is needed for interaction with the Aylanetworks API. This data was gathered from proxy traffic. 

The powershell module is a way to interact with the endpoints via Powershell.

Home Assistant would likely need this code converted to Python in addition to any module integration.

The softener does have an http webpage for wifi status and connect/disconnect. It has not been probed further at this time to identify if local control is possible.
